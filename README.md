# Next.js 15 Unexpected Routing Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Next.js 15 related to unexpected routing behavior when using the `useRouter` hook for navigation.  The issue occurs when navigating from one page to another, sometimes resulting in the navigation failing silently or leading to an incorrect URL in the browser.

## Bug Description

The navigation from the `/about` page to the `/contact` page using `router.push` fails to update the browser URL correctly.  The page content updates, but the URL remains on the `/about` route. This can lead to issues with deep linking and other client-side interactions.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Click the button to go to `/contact`.
6. Observe that the URL does not update to `/contact`, even though the content displays.

## Solution

The provided solution ensures proper client-side routing using a combination of techniques, solving unexpected behavior in the routing process. The solution ensures consistent and correct URL updates in the browser.
